Reads words (separated by whitespace only and not any 
other punctuation or special characters) from the user 
until logical end-of-file

Prints the count of words (just an integer) that start with 
an English vowel, i.e., one of "AEIOUaeiou" characters. 

For example, given just the sentence "Elephants are 
Awesome animals" the output will be 4. Similarly, for 
the input "I think I am warming up to c++" the output 
will be 4 as well.
